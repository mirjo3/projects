# Medicare Opioid Treatment Program
data source: https://data.cms.gov/provider-characteristics/medicare-provider-supplier-enrollment/opioid-treatment-program-providers

## Objective
Capstone project using Python and Tableau to show how to Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act on a given dataset.

## Introduction
The opioid crisis in the United States persists, with limited resources due to cost and availability. Non-profits and local governments have taken the initiative to assist those affected. The federal government can offer support, similar to Medicare and Medicaid, to those without access to private sector services.

## Methodology
Our aim can be achieved by using a variety of data analysis techniques and examining publicly available data:

Dataset Acquisition: The dataset used for this project was sourced from public government agencies. The datasets are provided via APIs.

Software: Python was used to retrieve a dataset from an API, clean, manipulate, and fix all possible data tables.

Visualization: Tableau provided graphs, charts, and plots to distill long datasets

By combining these methodologies, we are able to gain valuable insights into the distribution of medicare sponsored opioid treatment programs.

## Conclusion

Through the assimilation of census data and the count of opioid programs within each state, the federal government can partner with state governments to determine the ratio of treatment centers per capita. This information can be utilized to identify regions with varying levels of accessibility to these crucial services.

While the accessibility of private healthcare services is desirable, these opportunities are not equitably available to all individuals. By pinpointing areas where the federal government can make improvements, public tax funds can be invested in promoting recovery and enhancing the life expectancy of the average American citizen.
