# Workflow Optimization
Data Source: BD Pyxis & BD PARx Hospital Activity Reports.
Dataset is not shared publicly for privacy.

## Objective
Rebalance and establish workflows for sixteen inpatient pharmacy technician shifts leveraging data insights.

## Background
With the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the hospital, the department began reorganizing the sixteen technician shifts under new leadership.

## Methodology
In order to accomplish our goal, we implemented a comprehensive strategy.

Data Collection: Leveraged BD-generated reports, conducted personnel interviews, and employed visualization techniques for data-driven decision-making.

Dataset Acquisition: By incorporating feedback from our staff experts, utilizing BDâ€™s Pyxis Activity and PARx reports, and integrating the findings from our weekly shift testing, we were able to make significant improvements.

Software: Microsoft Excel was used to gather, clean, manipulate, and correct data.

Visualization: Created dashboards and graphs using Excel.

Despite allocating additional resources to the morning shift, the evening team encountered reduced workload, resulting in missed medication pulls from the evening staff and increased the morning medication pulls.

Even though refill activities were balanced, the push for a shift to come in later led to reduced staffing in the main department. This directly resulted in increased phone traffic and delays in STAT medication deliveries as staff members were occupied with on-floor deliveries.

After workflow adjustments, we effectively managed evening medication pulls, ensured timely deliveries, and maintained sufficient in-pharmacy staff to handle both new start and STAT deliveries and phone inquiries.

Workflow is now equitably distributed among the sixteen shifts, with the morning and evening teams having eight staff members each. We've strategically reallocated ancillary, non-urgent tasks to the evening shift, complementing the morning team's total hospital active duties.

## Conclusion
Through consistent practice, looking at the data, making adjustments, and receiving weekly feedback, we were able to successfully implement a new workflow that evenly distributed tasks between the morning and evening shifts for all sixteen crews. To explain the reasoning behind specific side duties assigned to different shifts, charts were distributed to the team to provide context between the shift trials and changes.
