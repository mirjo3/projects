# Workflow Optimization
Data Source: BD Pyxis & BD PARx Hospital Activity Reports
Dataset is not shared publicly for privacy.

## Objective
Rebalance and establish workflows for sixteen inpatient pharmacy technician shifts leveraging data insights.

## Background
As COVID-19 restrictions waned in the hospital environment, the department embarked on restructuring the 17 different technician shifts under new leadership.

## Methodology
To achieve our goal, we adopted a comprehensive approach:

Data Collection: Leveraged BD-generated reports, conducted personnel interviews, and employed visualization techniques for data-driven decision-making.

Dataset Acquisition: Incorporated feedback from staff experts, utilized BD's Pyxis Activity and PARx reports, and integrated findings from weekly shift testing.

Software: Utilized Microsoft Excel for data gathering, cleaning, manipulation, and correction.

Visualization: Created dashboards and graphs using Excel.

Despite allocating additional resources to the morning shift, the evening team encountered reduced workload, resulting in missed medication pulls from evening medical staff and increased the morning medication pulls.

Even though refill activities were balanced, the push for a shift to come in later led to reduced staffing in the main department. This directly resulted in increased phone traffic and delays in STAT medication deliveries as staff members were occupied with on-floor deliveries.

After strategic workflow adjustments, we effectively managed evening medication pulls, ensured timely deliveries, and maintained sufficient in-pharmacy staff to handle both new start and STAT deliveries and phone inquiries.

Workflow is now equitably distributed among the sixteen shifts, with the morning and evening teams having eight staff members each. We've strategically reallocated ancillary, non-urgent tasks to the evening shift, complementing the morning team's total hospital active duties.

## Conclusion
By meticulously integrating and honing these methodologies, we navigated through numerous trials and challenges. Ultimately, we harnessed actionable insights that enabled us to effectively identify and harmonize the distribution of sixteen distinct shifts and their corresponding responsibilities in an impressively timely manner.
