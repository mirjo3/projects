# Workforce Distribution Optimization

Excel-based analysis optimizing workload distribution across 16 inpatient pharmacy technician shifts. Uses activity data and staff feedback to balance productivity and eliminate workflow bottlenecks.

## Overview

Analyzed pharmacy workflow data to redistribute job duties across 16 shifts during post-COVID departmental reorganization. Combined quantitative activity reports with qualitative staff input to achieve balanced workload distribution.

**Key Features:**
- Multi-shift activity analysis using BD Pyxis reports
- Staff interview integration for workflow insights
- Iterative testing with data-driven adjustments
- Visual dashboard tracking for management decisions

## Data Sources

- **BD Pyxis Activity Reports** - Medication dispensing patterns
- **BD PARx Reports** - Inventory refill activities  
- **Staff Interviews** - Workflow pain points and suggestions
- **Weekly Testing Data** - Trial period performance metrics

*Note: Hospital data not publicly shared for privacy compliance*

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Extracted activity reports from BD systems
- Conducted staff interviews across all 16 shifts
- Tracked performance metrics during trial periods

### 2. Analysis Process
- Analyzed medication pull patterns by shift timing
- Identified workload imbalances between morning/evening teams
- Measured impact of staffing changes on delivery times

### 3. Iterative Testing
- **Trial 1:** Additional morning resources → Evening workload gaps
- **Trial 2:** Later shift start → Reduced pharmacy coverage  
- **Trial 3:** Optimized timing → Balanced workflow achieved

## Key Results

### Problem Identification
- Uneven medication pull distribution between shifts
- STAT delivery delays during coverage gaps
- Phone traffic spikes during understaffing periods

### Solution Implementation
- Redistributed ancillary tasks to evening shifts
- Balanced morning/evening teams (8 staff each)
- Maintained adequate pharmacy coverage for urgent needs

### Final Outcome
**Workflow now equitably distributed across 16 shifts with:**
- Balanced medication pull responsibilities
- Improved STAT delivery response times
- Reduced phone traffic delays
- Strategic task allocation by shift priority

## Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel:** Data processing, analysis, and visualization
- **BD Pyxis/PARx Systems:** Hospital activity reporting
- **Dashboard Creation:** Excel charts and graphs for management reporting

## Business Impact

- **Efficiency:** Eliminated workflow bottlenecks between shifts
- **Staff Satisfaction:** Balanced workload reduces burnout
- **Patient Care:** Faster STAT medication delivery
- **Resource Optimization:** Strategic task allocation by shift capacity

## Visualizations

![First trial](https://github.com/mirjo3/projects/blob/c5c93eb9fd529d0c61489599ae0d1ea63aeab379/workflow_optimization/Shift%20Comparison%20Aggregate%20(PXT2%20at%201100).png)
Despite allocating additional resources to the morning shift, the evening team encountered reduced workload, resulting in missed medication pulls from the evening staff and increased the morning medication pulls.

![Second Trial](https://github.com/mirjo3/projects/blob/c5c93eb9fd529d0c61489599ae0d1ea63aeab379/workflow_optimization/Shift%20Comparison%20Aggregate%20(PXT2%20At%201430).png)
Even though refill activities were balanced, the push for a shift to come in later led to reduced staffing in the main department. This directly resulted in increased phone traffic and delays in STAT medication deliveries as staff members were occupied with on-floor deliveries.

![Third Trial](https://github.com/mirjo3/projects/blob/c5c93eb9fd529d0c61489599ae0d1ea63aeab379/workflow_optimization/Shift%20Comparison%20Aggregate%20(PXT2%20At%201200).png)
After workflow adjustments, we effectively managed evening medication pulls, ensured timely deliveries, and maintained sufficient in-pharmacy staff to handle both new start and STAT deliveries and phone inquiries.

![September Comparison](https://github.com/mirjo3/projects/blob/c2c462c7ad26b95da0b95001c8f0d9f6773e1677/workflow_optimization/%5BSep%5D%20AVERAGES%20OF%20PARX%20%26%20TOTAL%20REFILL_LOAD%20ACTIVITY.png)
Workflow is now equitably distributed among the sixteen shifts, with the morning and evening teams having eight staff members each. We've strategically reallocated ancillary, non-urgent tasks to the evening shift, complementing the morning team's total hospital active duties.
